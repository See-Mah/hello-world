# hello-world

My first repository

I am not a programer at the moment, nor am I studying to become one. I would however, like to learn about this space as I understand its importance in our lives. Im here to learn as much as I can.

Also, I'm a fan of Bitcoin and would like to one day help in its development, even if it's indirectly.
